## **Process for Sales Data Analysis Project**  

### **1. Data Collection**  
- Gather sales data from Excel sheets (Sales Data, Final Working, Dashboard).  
- Identify key variables (Date, SalesRep, Product, Units Sold, Price, Total Sales, Region, etc.).  

### **2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
- Handle missing values and inconsistencies.  
- Convert data types (dates, numerical values).  
- Remove duplicate records if any.  

### **3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Summarize total sales, units sold, and average price.  
- Identify trends in sales over time (daily, weekly, monthly).  
- Perform product-wise and region-wise sales distribution.  

### **4. KPI Calculation**  
- Compute **Total Sales**, **% Target Achieved**, and **Sales Gap**.  
- Identify **Top & Bottom Products**, **Highest Selling Regions**, and **SalesRep Performance**.  
- Analyze **city/state-wise revenue contribution**.  

### **5. Visualization & Insights**  
- Create graphs for sales trends, top products, and regional sales.  
- Use dashboards for easy interpretation.  

### **6. Reporting & Recommendations**  
- Summarize findings.  
- Suggest strategies to improve sales, target weaker regions, and optimize inventory.  

This process ensures a structured approach to analyzing and improving sales performance.
