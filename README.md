- Convert data types (dates, numerical values).  
- Remove duplicate records if any.  

### **3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

- Perform product-wise and region-wise sales distribution.  

### **4. KPI Calculation**  
- Compute **Total Sales**, **% Target Achieved**, and **Sales Gap**.  
- Identify **Top & Bottom Products**, **Highest Selling Regions**, and **SalesRep Performance**.  
- Analyze **city/state-wise revenue contribution**.  

### **5. Visualization & Insights**  
- Create graphs for sales trends, top products, and regional sales.  
- Use dashboards for easy interpretation.  

### **6. Reporting & Recommendations**

## Insights After Data Analysis
### 1. Sales Performance Analysis
The actual sales revenue is lower than the target, indicating a shortfall in achieving business goals.

Percentage Achievement: The sales team achieved approximately 81% of the target, leaving a 19% gap.

Identifying the reasons for this gap (pricing, competition, demand fluctuations) can help improve future performance.

### 2. Product-Wise Performance
Best-Selling Products: Some products, like Nestle Smarties Pop-Up and Nestle Fab, contribute significantly to total revenue.

Low-Selling Products: Products like Nestle Rolo Potz have lower sales, which may indicate poor customer demand, pricing issues, or lack of promotion.

Revenue Contribution: The top 5 products contribute a large portion of total sales, meaning focusing on these products can maximize profits.

Actionable Insight: Low-performing products may need discounts, marketing efforts, or even discontinuation if they are consistently underperforming.

### 3. Regional & City-Wise Analysis
Top-Performing Regions:

States like Delhi, Gujarat, and Maharashtra contribute significantly to overall sales.

Cities like Ahmedabad and Bangalore show high sales volume, indicating strong customer demand.

Underperforming Regions:

States like Himachal Pradesh and Jharkhand have lower sales figures.

These areas may need more aggressive marketing, better distribution channels, or localized promotions.

Actionable Insight: Sales teams should focus more on low-performing regions while maintaining high performance in strong markets.

### 4. Sales Trends & Seasonality
Sales fluctuate across different periods (daily, weekly, monthly).

Identifying peak sales periods can help businesses plan better inventory management and promotional campaigns.

If sales drop on certain days or months, businesses can introduce seasonal discounts or festive offers to boost sales.

### 5. Sales Representative Performance
Some sales representatives significantly outperform others, contributing higher revenue.

Identifying top-performing sales reps can help create training programs for underperforming reps.

Incentives or commission-based rewards can be introduced to motivate better performance across the team.

### 6. Customer Buying Behavior
Some products are more popular in certain regions, meaning localized marketing strategies can be effective.

Certain customers may buy in bulk, while others prefer small purchasesâ€”understanding this pattern can influence pricing strategies.
